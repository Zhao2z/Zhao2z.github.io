My name is Zhao2z, and I am a Ph.D. student at Wuhan University, majoring in Software Engineering.
I am currently being supervised by Professor [Xuan](http://jifeng-xuan.com) and am a member of the [CSTAR](https://cstar.whu.edu.cn) lab.
My research interests encompass software engineering, software testing, and program repair.


### My Story
I was born and raised in Hubei, China.
I received my Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering from Wuhan University in 2023.
Then I joined the CSTAR lab and started my Ph.D. study.

Before university, I graduated from the [No.1 Senior High School of WEDZ](https://www.kfqyz.cn/).
