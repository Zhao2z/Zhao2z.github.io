My name is Zhao2z, and I'm a PHD student at Wuhan University majoring in Software Engineering.
I'm under the supervision of [Prof. Xuan](http://jifeng-xuan.com/) and I'm a member of the [CSTAR](https://cstar.whu.edu.cn) lab.
My research interests include software engineering, software testing, and program repair.



### My story

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [my movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29) and it will answer **all** your questions.
